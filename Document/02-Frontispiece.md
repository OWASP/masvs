# About the Standard

<img src="images/owasp_mas_header.png" width="100%" />

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is the industry standard for mobile application security. It provides a comprehensive set of security controls that can be used to assess the security of mobile apps across various platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) and deployment scenarios (e.g., consumer, enterprise). The standard covers the key components of the mobile app attack surface including storage, cryptography, authentication and authorization, network communication, interaction with the mobile platform, code quality and resilience against reverse engineering and tampering.

The OWASP MASVS is the result of years of community effort and industry feedback. We thank all the contributors who have helped shape this standard. We welcome your feedback on the OWASP MASVS at any time, especially as you apply it to your own organization and mobile app development projects. Getting inputs from a variety of mobile app developers will help us improve and update the standard which is revised periodically based on your inputs and feedback.

## Authors

### Bernhard Mueller

Bernhard is a cyber security specialist with a talent for hacking systems of all kinds. During more than a decade in the industry, he has published many zero-day exploits for software such as MS SQL Server, Adobe Flash Player, IBM Director, Cisco VOIP, and ModSecurity. If you can name it, he has probably broken it at least once. BlackHat USA commended his pioneering work in mobile security with a Pwnie Award for Best Research.

### Sven Schleier

Sven is an experienced web and mobile penetration tester and assessed everything from historic Flash applications to progressive mobile apps. He is also a security engineer that supported many projects end-to-end during the SDLC to "build security in". He was speaking at local and international meetups and conferences and is conducting hands-on workshops about web application and mobile app security.

### Jeroen Willemsen

Jeroen is a principal security architect with a passion for mobile security and risk management. He has supported companies as a security coach, a security engineer and as a full-stack developer, which makes him a jack of all trades. He loves explaining technical subjects: from security issues to programming challenges.

### Carlos Holguera

Carlos is a mobile security research engineer who has gained many years of hands-on experience in the field of security testing for mobile apps and embedded systems such as automotive control units and IoT devices. He is passionate about reverse engineering and dynamic instrumentation of mobile apps and is continuously learning and sharing his knowledge.

### Jeroen Beckers

Jeroen is a mobile security lead responsible for quality assurance on mobile security projects and for R&D on all things mobile. Although he started his career as a programmer, he found that it was more fun to take things apart than to put things together, and the switch to security was quickly made. Ever since his master's thesis on Android security, Jeroen has been interested in mobile devices and their (in)security. He loves sharing his knowledge with other people, as is demonstrated by his many talks & trainings at colleges, universities, clients and conferences.

## Donators

While both the MASVS and the MASTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to be able to hire technical editors. Note that their donation does not influence the content of the MASVS or MASTG in any way. The Donation Packages are described on the [OWASP Project Wiki](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide#tab=Sponsorship_Packages "OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide Donation Packages").

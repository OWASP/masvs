# Assessment and Certification

## OWASP's Stance on MASVS Certifications and Trust Marks

OWASP, as a vendor-neutral not-for-profit organization, does not certify any vendors, verifiers or software.

All such assurance assertions, trust marks, or certifications are not officially vetted, registered, or certified by OWASP, so an organization relying upon such a view needs to be cautious of the trust placed in any third party or trust mark claiming ASVS certification.

This should not inhibit organizations from offering such assurance services, as long as they do not claim official OWASP certification.

## Guidance for Certifying Mobile Apps

The Application Security Verification Standard can be used as an open book verification of the application, including open and unfettered access to key resources such as architects and developers, project documentation, source code, authenticated access to test systems (including access to at least one account in each role), particularly for L2 and higher.

Historically, black-box security testing and secure code reviews have included issues "by exception" â€“ that is only failed issues appear in the final report. A certifying organization must include in any report the scope of the verification (particularly if a key component is out of scope, such as SSO authentication), a summary of verification findings, including passed and failed tests, with clear indications of how to resolve the failed tests.

Keeping detailed work papers, screenshots or movies, scripts to reliably and repeatedly exploit an issue, and electronic records of testing, such as intercepting proxy logs and associated notes such as a cleanup list, is considered standard industry practice and can be really useful as proofs of the findings as well as for reproduction. It is not sufficient to simply run a tool and report on the failures; this does not provide sufficient evidence that all issues at a certifying level have been tested and tested thoroughly. In case of dispute, there should be sufficient supportive evidence to demonstrate each and every verified requirement has indeed been tested.

### Using the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

### The role of automated security testing tools

The use of source code scanners and black-box testing tools is encouraged in order to increase efficiency whenever possible. It is however not possible to complete MASVS verification using automated tools alone: Every mobile app is different, and understanding the overall architecture, business logic, and technical pitfalls of the specific technologies and frameworks being used, is a mandatory requirement to verify security of the app.

## Other uses

### As detailed security architecture guidance

One of the more common uses for the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard is as a resource for security architects. The two major security architecture frameworks, SABSA or TOGAF, are missing a great deal of information that is necessary to complete mobile application security architecture reviews. MASVS can be used to fill in those gaps by allowing security architects to choose better controls for issues common to mobile apps.

### As a replacement for off the shelf secure coding checklists

Many organizations can benefit from adopting the MASVS, by choosing one of the four levels, or by forking MASVS and changing what is required for each application's risk level in a domain-specific way. We encourage this type of forking as long as traceability is maintained, so that if an app has passed requirement 4.1, this means the same thing for forked copies as the standard evolves.

### As a basis for security testing methodologies

A good mobile app security testing methodology should cover all requirements listed in the MASVS. The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) describes black-box and white-box test cases for each verification requirement.

### As a guide for automated unit and integration tests

The MASVS is designed to be highly testable, with the sole exception of architectural requirements. Automated unit, integration and acceptance testing based on the MASVS requirements can be integrated in the continuous development lifecycle. This not only increases developer security awareness, but also improves the overall quality of the resulting apps, and reduces the amount of findings during security testing in the pre-release phase.

### For secure development training

MASVS can also be used to define characteristics of secure mobile apps. Many "secure coding" courses are simply ethical hacking courses with a light smear of coding tips. This does not help developers. Instead, secure development courses can use the MASVS, with a strong focus on the proactive controls documented in the MASVS, rather than e.g. the Top 10 code security issues.

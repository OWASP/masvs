## About the Standard

The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard is a list of security requirements for mobile applications that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and consumers to define what a secure mobile application is.

This guide is a fork of the Mobile OWASP Web Application Security Standard written by Jim Manico.

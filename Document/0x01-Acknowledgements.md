## About the Standard

The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard is a list of security requirements for mobile applications that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and consumers to define what a secure mobile application is. Together with the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG), it provides a comprehensive set of requirements and test cases for mobile app security verification. WStandalone use of the MASVS requirements within all phases of the mobile app SDLC is also encouraged.

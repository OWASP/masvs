## About the Standard

The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard contains a comprehensive list of mobile app security requirements. It can be used in combination with the closely related Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) to verify the security of mobile apps. Standalone use of the MASVS requirements for implementing a Secure mobile SDLC is also encouraged.

This document was started as a fork of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard written by Jim Manico.

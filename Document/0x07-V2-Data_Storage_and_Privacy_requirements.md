# V2: Data Storage and Privacy requirements

## Control objective

Authentication is the act of establishing, or confirming, something (or someone) as authentic, that is, that claims made by or about the thing are true. Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high level requirements:

- Verifies the digital identity of the sender of a communication.
- Ensures that only those authorised are able to authenticate and credentials are transported in a secure manner.

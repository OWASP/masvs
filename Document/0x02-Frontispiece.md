## About the Standard

Welcome to the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) 1.1. The MASVS is a community effort to establish a framework of security requirements needed to design, develop and test secure mobile apps on iOS and Android.

The MASVS is a culmination of community effort and industry feedback. We expect this standard to evolve over time and welcome feedback from the community. The best way to get in contact with us is via the OWASP Mobile Project Slack channel:

## Sponsors

While both the MASVS and the MSTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. We therefore thank our sponsors for providing the funds to be able to hire technical editors. Note that their sponsorship does not influence the content of the MASVS or MSTG in any way. The sponsorship packages are described on the [OWASP Project Wiki](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide#tab=Sponsorship_Packages "OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide Sponsorship Packages").

# About Verification and Certifiation

## OWASP's stance on MASVS Certifications and Trust Marks

OWASP, as a vendor-neutral not-for-profit organisation, does not certify any vendors, verifiers or software.

All such assurance assertions, trust marks, or certifications are not officially vetted, registered, or certified by OWASP, so an organization relying upon such a view needs to be cautious of the trust placed in any third party or trust mark claiming ASVS certification.

This should not inhibit organizations from offering such assurance services, as long as they do not claim official OWASP certification.

## Guidance for certifying organizations

The Application Security Verification Standard can be used as an open book verification of the application, including open and unfettered access to key resources such as architects and developers, project documentation, source code, authenticated access to test systems (including access to at least one account in each role), particularly for L2 and L3 verifications.

Historically, black-box testing and secure code reviews have included issues "by exception" â€“ that is only failed issues appear in the final report. A certifying organization must include in any report the scope of the verification (particularly if a key component is out of scope, such as SSO authentication), a summary of verification findings, including passed and failed tests, with clear indications of how to resolve the failed tests.

Keeping detailed work papers, screenshots or movies, scripts to reliably and repeatedly exploit an issue, and electronic records of testing, such as intercepting proxy logs and associated notes such as a cleanup list, is considered standard industry practice and can be really useful as proofs of the findings for the most doubts developers. It is not sufficient to simply run a tool and report on the failures; this does not (at all) provide sufficient evidence that all issues at a certifying level have been tested and tested thoroughly. In case of dispute, there should be sufficient assurance evidence to demonstrate each and every verified requirement has indeed been tested.

## The role of automated security testing tools

The use of source code scanners and black-box testing tools is encouraged to provide as much as possible coverage and to exercise as many parameters as possible with many different forms of malicious inputs as possible.

It is not however not possible to fully complete MASVS verification using automated tools alone. (... todo - why? ...)

Please note that the lines between automated and manual testing have blurred as the application security industry matures. Automated tools are often manually tuned by experts and manual testers often leverage a wide variety of automated tools.

## As detailed security architecture guidance

One of the more common uses for the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard is as a resource for security architects. The two major security architecture frameworks, SABSA or TOGAF, are missing a great deal of information that is necessary to complete mobile application security architecture reviews. MASVS can be used to fill in those gaps by allowing security architects to choose better controls for issues common to mobile apps.

## As a replacement for off the shelf secure coding checklists

Many organizations can benefit from adopting the MASVS, by choosing one of the four levels, or by forking MASVS and changing what is required for each application risk level in a domain-specific way. We encourage this type of forking as long as traceability is maintained, so that if an app has passed requirement 4.1, this means the same thing for forked copies as the standard evolves.

## As a guide for automated unit and integration tests

The MASVS is designed to highly testable, with the sole exception of architectural requirements. By building unit and integration tests that test for specific requirements, the mobile app becomes nearly self-verifying with each and every build. For example, additional tests can be crafted for the test suite for (...) todo (...).

## For secure development training

MASVS can also be used to define characteristics of secure mobile apps. Many "secure coding" courses are simply ethical hacking courses with a light smear of coding tips. This does not help developers. Instead, secure development courses can use the MASVS with a strong focus on the proactive controls found in the MASVS, rather than the Top 10 negative things not to do.

# V8: User Education Requirements

## Control Objective

Data security is highly dependent on the configuration of the device as well as the context in which the app is installed. To help limit risk, an app that stores sensitive data should inform the user about security best practices. The goal is to encourage users to take actions that reduce the risk of data exposure.

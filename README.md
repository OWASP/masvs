# OWASP MASVS

This is the official Github Repository of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). It started as a fork of ethicalhack3r's Markdown version of the OWASP ASVS 3.0. The MASVS can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of mobile apps. The MASVS is intended to be used in the following ways:

- Use as a metric - To provide application developers and application owners with a framework wich allows to measure the security, and thus the degree of trust that can be placed in their mobile applications.
- Use as guidance - To provide guidance in regards to security controls necessary to implement in order to satisfy application security requirements
- Use during procurement - Provide a baseline for mobile app security verification requirements.
